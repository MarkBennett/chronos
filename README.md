Chronos
=======

Open your time - an open source, liberally licensed, time tracking platform

Motivation
===========

Inspired by the unix notion of simple single purpose tools, Chronos is intended to provide an open time tracking platform upon which other tools may be built. It is intended to enable simple integration with other systems via a plugin architecture and a toolable JSON / HTTP API.

User Stories
============
1. As a developer, I can start and stop a task timer from multiple devices, so that I can record my time without worrying about changing devices or locations.
2. As a developer, I can receive reminders at regular intervals during working hours, so that I don't forget to record what I'm doing.
3. As a developer, I can complete a timesheet at the end of the day in no more than 2 minutes, so that I don't start to dislike entering times.
4. As a developer, I can bundle up unbilled times into an invoice which can be submitted to other systems, so that I can get paid for my time.
